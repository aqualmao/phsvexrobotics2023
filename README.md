# phsvexrobotics2023

this is the github page for pickering's 2023 vexIQ robotics competition stuff

commit stuff-
if your making any commits to anything **make sure it works first**, then add what changes you're making to the code. then it'll get reviewed and if it works it'll be added.
also when you are making a commit, i think you'll have to create a new .iq(lang) file, then paste your code in there if it's not block code. for some reason the online VEXcode compiles the code into a weird format that vscode (or any other IDE) doesn't really read.

languages-
there will be either 2 or 3 types to releases, Block (easiest, block method), Python (pretty easy, text language), and C++ (relatively hard, text language)
we can only use python if the brain of our robot is v2 (im not sure which it is, i'll check when i can.) if it's v1, we're only able to use block and C++.
personally i'd suggest trying out the text coding for a little bit of a challenge, but whatever you feel most comfortable and optimal in would probably be best.
